As a part of this task you need to develop an API. The API will support uploading a file to server and reading the file to search for some content. You need to support:

a. POST request: Upload a file to server. Max file size for uploaded file to be 5 MB. You will have to provide an interface of file upload.
b. GET request: User will send a text with GET request. The text should be searched in the file uploaded and should return the line number where the text is found. If not found, should return 0.

You are free to use any language you think is needed.

You need to provide a build/deploy script, which will install all the dependencies and put the API up for consumption. We will just execute this script and everything should be deployed.

Your solution will be judged on:
1. How easy is the deployment.
2. How well you handle the edge cases.
3. How good your coding standards are.
